The main idea of the project was inspired by CTFd and the idea for levels was inspired by OverTheWire.
The textscrabble effect was taken from [here](https://codepen.io/soulwire/pen/mEMPrK) the home page ui is a modified version of an existing boostrap template that can be found [here](https://htmltemplates.co/) As pablo picasso said "Good artists copy, great artists steal" we want to thank the original creators of these resources.
